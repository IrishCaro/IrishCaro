	 What is a URL?

     A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet.
	 It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and 
	 domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.

	 The sourceAnchor attribute is defined as an attribute immutable during the lifetime of an object. 
	 It uniquely identifies an object as being the same object on-premises and in Microsoft Entra ID.
	 The attribute is also called immutableId and the two names are used interchangeably.

	 The source anchor points to a destination anchor, usually another file, whose location is specified by the href attribute in the source anchor.
	 The target of a hyperlink can be another document, or location within the same document, to which the hyperlink leads.
	 Users can activate and follow the link, usually by clicking on the anchor with a mouse or any other pointing device.

	 Dreamweaver provides several ways to create links to documents, images, multimedia files, or downloadable software.
	 You can establish links to any text or image anywhere within a document, including text or images in a heading, list, table, 
	 absolutely-positioned element (AP element), or frame. There are several different ways of creating and managing links. 
	 Some web designers prefer to create links to nonexistent pages or files as they work, while others prefer to create all the
	 files and pages first and then add the links. Another way to manage links is to create placeholder pages, in which you add and test
	 links before completing all your site pages.
